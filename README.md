# create_requirements
This version of the script will now write the package names along with their versions in the 'requirements.txt' file. When you run the script, it will create a file named 'requirements.txt' in the same directory with lines like 'package_name==version' for each installed package.
Otherwise you can use a shell command, which is more easy.
